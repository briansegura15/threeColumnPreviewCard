## My process

Downloaded all starter files. Downloaded and linked all fonts required. Built out HTML and got to working on CSS. Active state implemented after CSS was complete and media query added for responsiveness after active state was completed. (this was my first media query implementation! Woohoo ! ðŸ¤ ) 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Biggest take away from this was finally being brave enough to use a media query and make my page responsive! Flexbox does a lot of the heavy lifting, so again, was happy to be able to work with it. Using psuedo classes was also a good learning experience.
